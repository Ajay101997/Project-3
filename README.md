# 🏠 House Price Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a housing dataset to understand the key factors that influence house prices. The analysis covers **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate** techniques using Python.

---

## 📌 Objective
To explore the dataset, identify important features affecting house prices, and gain insights that can support future prediction models.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Rows: 1460  
- Columns: 81  
- Numeric Features: 38  
- Categorical Features: 43  
- Target Variable: `SalePrice`

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- **Univariate Analysis** – Distribution and outlier detection  
- **Bivariate Analysis** – Relationships with `SalePrice`  
- **Multivariate Analysis** – Feature interactions and correlation heatmap  
- **Outlier Handling** – IQR-based capping method

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `GarageCars`, `TotalBsmtSF`, and `Neighborhood` strongly influence house prices.  
- Larger and higher-quality houses tend to have higher sale prices.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Build machine learning models for price prediction  
- Perform feature engineering and model tuning
